  abstract  = {This paper explores the research issues related to personal computing within the corporate environment. A definition of personal computing is first offered, followed by an examination of how it relates to other areas, such as distributed processing, database management, office automation, software engineering, and artificial intelligence. Finally, specific research issues that are fundamental to the further development of the personal computing field are presented.},
